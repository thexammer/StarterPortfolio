### Project Description:

Dogs Day is an interactive fiction about a lonely man who finds some lost dogs and has to return them home. It was originally made in 48 hours for the <a target="_blank" href=https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/dogs-day>Global Game Jam 2019</a> and was then finished later in the year.

### Reflection

Usually I like working on games that have some lower level systems that I can work on, but with Dogs Day I really was pulled in by the narrative and passion of the artists making the pitch. While it might not have been the most interesting game to work on from a programming standpoint, I still very much enjoyed implementing the story and bringing my artists' vision to life, which is why I came back later in the year to finish the game. This project is also the first I dabbled into doing some light audio implementation and sparked my interest that I would further expand on other projects and jobs. One thing I would change in the process of making this game would be putting more thought into the level design as I found it pretty easy to just get lost and not know where to go next.
