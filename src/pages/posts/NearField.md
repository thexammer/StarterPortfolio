### Project Description:

Near-Field Gladitor is an arena fighter made in 48 hours for the <a target="_blank" href=https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019>GMTK Game Jam 2019</a>. The player weilds a magnet that, when activated, pulls a large, spinning glaive towards them.<!-- excerpt --> Players must use this weapon to fight off a few different types of enemies, of which they can only see the closest, while also avoiding hitting themselves with the weapon. Upon submission to the jam Near-Field Gladitor was ranked <a target="_blank" href=https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019/rate/463524>#80</a> overall by player ratings.

### Reflection:

I really enjoyed what came out of this project. I was working in Unity at <a target="_blank" href=https://www.neuroscouting.com/>NeuroScouting</a> at the time so mostly I wanted to try out using what I'd learned from them. That happened to be making the enemies since most of what I learned beyond syntax was how to use OOD principles in Unity and an enemy system seemed to me the best chance to apply that. I was also doing some audio work for them so I took on implementing the audio made by our awesome artist. Looking back I wish we had spent a bit more time making more of a progression to the game to keep people engaged beyond the first few minutes.
