### Project Description:

Over the course of a Game Engines class, a couple classmates and I created a functional 2D game engine in C++ using SDL as a framework. The project comes with a couple demo games (Breakout, a simple platformer, and a Nuclear Throne clone) and a level editor that functions for each game.<!-- excerpt --> It is based on an Entity Component system and has resource sharing, profiling, localization, and a custom math and physics library.

### Personal Contributions

<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>Created the visual level editor.</li><li>Wrote much of the collision detection and physics library</li><li>Handled much of the physics and collisions specific to the example games.</li></ul>

### Reflection

Game Engines was one of my favorite classes I've taken (I actually read the whole <a target="_blank" href=https://www.gameenginebook.com/>book</a>!). Lower level systems are my favorite things to work with and design so getting to implement the majority of a game engine was a lot of fun. Once we got to the point that our engine was mostly working I moved over to making our level editor since I wanted to work on some more tools. I really appreciate this project looking back as it gave me a good idea of the systems in place in the engines that I use.
