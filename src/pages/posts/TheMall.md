### Project Description:

THEMALL is an experience about exploring a liminal mall. It is essentially a collection of strange rooms that float around a mall-like space. Each store has its own soundtrack and distinct feeling. THEMALL was made in 48ish hours for the <a target="_blank" href=https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/themall-1>Global Game Jam 2021</a>.

### Reflection

This one I got dragged into solely because I liked the vibes of the game and the people working on it. I strayed a little far from my normal programming role here since there weren't a lot of systems to create. I was still able to make a pretty good node-based movement system to get things moving around, complete with some editor functionality to make it easier for the designers on the game to use. I do wish I was able to put a bit more functionality in to make it more of a game, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out and the response it got.
